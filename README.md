Overview of the project: 

The project is about Interactive map of University College Nordjylland (UCN). Using HTML5, CSS3, 
JavaScript, SVG, HTML5 Canvas. When a new student comes to school and he has no idea where to go, 
instead of going to administration every time he can use this interactive map to find his way around the campus. 
The map is basically a video where you can choose which way of the camps you want to go and user has given
options if he wants to go right, left or forward then he has to press particular button. The user
has given few tasks and he has to complete those tasks in given period of time. Tasks must be
followed in order they are listed, if the user does not complete his first task and try to go to
the second task there will be a pop-up on the screen saying that he has to complete his first
task before he could jump to the second task. There will be a small map on the screen and a
pointer. So when the video is playing the pointer will move according to the video that will
help user to see where he is on the map of the UCN.
